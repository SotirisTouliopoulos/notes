# Notes on the steady-state assumption in metabolic networks


## The steady-states assumption

A steady state is an equilibrial condition in a dynamic process in which the rate of input of a state variable is equal to the rate of output of that variable.
For a metabolic pathway at steady state, the rate of input into the pathway, the rate of conversion of A to B and the rate of output are all equal

When we analyze a metabolic network and obtain reactions fluxes, we get the fluxes in the steady-state condition.

If we change a reaction's flux, then we also alter the concentration of other metabolites in the system.
These metabolites must find a way to return to the original steady state or settle to a new one.

Thus, specific pathways are activated that increase or decrease the concentration of the metabolites.
